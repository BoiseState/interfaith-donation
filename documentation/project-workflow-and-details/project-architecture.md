# Project Architecture

This project can be broken up into three main sections:

1. Java Spring back-end with a Postgres database
2. Vue.js along with Spring back-end is for the admin tool
3. Ionic application for the front-end client

The Spring/Vue structure is for administration access. This is where Interfaith Sanctuary can manage their donation request system. The Ionic app will connect with this system and serve as an interface for donors to view and select possible donation items. Following link is the diagram that represents a high level project architecture.
