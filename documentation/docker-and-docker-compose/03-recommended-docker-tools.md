# Useful Docker Tools

These are some useful tools to help manage Docker containers started through both
a regular Docker build or Docker Compose.

## Kitematic

[Kitematic](https://kitematic.com/) is a user interface that lets you start, stop, restart, and manage
Docker containers that are currently running on your system. This is super useful for also
checking the individual logs of a specific container, or also adding containers to your current Docker
setup. This interface also works great with both Docker on Windows and Docker on Mac.
